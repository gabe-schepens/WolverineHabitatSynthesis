G. Schepens 2022
--- 

Dataset includes publicly-sourced environmental layers (.tiff) at 500m resolution, and code in a commented R script (.R) used to model wolverine habitat in the Columbia and Rocky Mountains, Canada for the above Schepens et al. manuscript. Metadata (.csv) for environmental and output layers are provided. 

Environmental data layers were compiled from public databases, and are included here for ease of script usage. Citations:
